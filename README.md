# lgc-Ahmes

Final assignment for the first term class, Introduction to Computer Architectures (translated name), from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS).

Finds the i-th number generated by the linear congruential generator formula: X(i+1) = (a * X(i) + b) mod n, given n, a, b, an initial X(0), and the final index, i. Doesn't test for coprimality or divisibility of supplied values, as that is not a requirement of the assignment. All numbers (including the result) should be 8-bit long.

The .ahd file is the assignment code proper, the .cpp code is a high-level implementation of the problem statement algorithm in (C-style) C++.
The .ahd file is assembly code for the Ahmes hypothetical computer, designed by professor Raul Fernando Weber at UFRGS, with its instruction set described in Prof. Weber's book, "Fundamentos de Arquitetura de Computadores". The code should be assembled with the Daedalus assembler.
Label naming is a messy mix of Portuguese and English, my apologies.
